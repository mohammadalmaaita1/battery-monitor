The system integrates precise hardware measurements, cloud-based data storage, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics to enhance battery performance, safety, and longevity. It addresses the limitations of traditional battery monitoring systems, such as lack of real-time remote access and predictive diagnostics, by leveraging IoT technologies and modern web frameworks.
Target Applications: The system is designed for use in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. It serves as an educational tool for engineering students, a prototyping platform for researchers, and a scalable solution for industry professionals working on battery management systems (BMS).
Compliance: The design adheres to the IEC 62133-2:2017 standard for secondary lithium-ion cells, ensuring safety in voltage monitoring and overcharge/over-discharge prevention.
2. Key Features
Real-Time Voltage Monitoring

Functionality: Continuous monitoring of individual cell voltages for a 4-cell lithium-ion battery pack, with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz (one reading per second).
Implementation: Utilizes a PCF8591 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) interfaced via I2C with a Raspberry Pi for accurate voltage measurements (±0.05 V).
Data Streaming: Employs Server-Sent Events (SSE) for low-latency, real-time data updates to a web-based dashboard.
Visualization: Displays live cell voltages with intuitive status indicators (e.g., Normal, Warning Low, Warning High, Critical) using graphical elements like battery icons and badges.

Cell Status Indication

Mechanism: Automatically assigns status based on customizable voltage thresholds stored in the browser's localStorage.
Thresholds: Configurable via a settings interface, allowing users to define voltage ranges for status classification (e.g., cell imbalance >0.1 V).

Historical Data Logging and Visualization

Storage: Voltage readings are stored in a MariaDB database, supporting up to 43,200 readings per cell to capture long-term behavioral trends.
Visualization: Interactive charts, built using modern JavaScript libraries, display voltage trends for the entire battery pack and individual cells.
Detailed Cell View: A modal interface provides per-cell historical charts, showing current voltage, status, and statistical metrics (minimum, maximum, and average voltages).

Data Export

Functionality: Users can export historical voltage data as CSV files for external analysis, facilitating research and reporting.

AI-Powered Diagnostics and Insights

Platform: Integrates Google Gemini models via the Genkit SDK for advanced diagnostics.
Diagnostic Reports: Generates detailed summaries of battery health, identifying anomalies such as cell imbalances (>0.1 V) with 95% accuracy in controlled test scenarios.
Predictive Alerts: Analyzes historical voltage trends to predict potential issues, such as rapid discharge or cell degradation.
Charging Advice: Provides AI-generated recommendations based on current battery state and user-provided context (e.g., storage duration or usage patterns).

Dashboard Statistics

Metrics: Displays pack-level metrics, including total pack voltage, cell voltage spread (difference between highest and lowest cell voltages), and per-cell statistics.
Timestamps: Indicates the last update time for live voltage data and dashboard statistics, ensuring transparency in data freshness.

User Interface and Experience

Framework: Built with Next.js 15 (App Router) and ShadCN UI components for a responsive, modern interface.
Design: Features a persistent dark theme, collapsible sidebar, and subtle electric-themed background animations for enhanced user engagement.
Additional Pages: Includes informational pages (About Us, Cooperation, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) to support user understanding and project context.
Loading Animation: Incorporates an electric-themed loading animation for an engaging user experience.

Firebase Firestore Integration

Purpose: Logs anonymous visit data (e.g., timestamps, user agent) and mirrors processed voltage readings from the frontend for auxiliary analysis.
Use Case: Enables separate data logging for frontend-specific applications or cross-platform analytics.
